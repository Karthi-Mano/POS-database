POS-database
============
A mobile Point of Sale Application developed for the Android platform.
The app aims to provide retail POS funtionality to remote regions that do not have access to electricity or internet.
This is achieved by using ad hoc connections to support communication between devices.
The ad hoc connection is hosted by a tethered connection maintained by one of the nodes in the network. (to be replaced with Wi-Fi direct connections)
One device acts as the database master and monitors transactions occuring on slave devices in the network.
Slave devices capture sales from the customer and relay this information to the master device.
This application is developed to support Android OS versions 2.3.3 and above.
